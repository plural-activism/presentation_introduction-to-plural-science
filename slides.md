### The history

- Earliest accounts since the end of the 18th Century¹
- Freud: Trauma is always subconscious
- 1970s: Sybil
- 1980s: Satanic Panic²
- 1990s: False Memory
- 2000s: Fantasy Model vs. Trauma Model
- 2010s: MRI Scans + Neurodiversity

The history of plural research can be described of an history to overcome biases.

We have a long history of evidence regarding dissociative disorders, but a lot of past stuff is very wacky, so lets start with

Freud had some quite pecuiliar ideas about trauma, and couldn't really make too much sense of dissociation, he did however insist that trauma is to be stored in the subconcious, and being able to retrieve it disproofs his theories, which had to be done by systems to be taken serious.

## Step 3: Reading research

---

### Where to find papers?

- Google Scholar
- ArchiveX
- Friends and researchers

---

![bg contain](./images/chad-researcher.png)

---

### The anatomy of a paper

![bg contain left](./images/anatomy-of-a-paper.jpg)

- Keywords
<!-- Only a handful allowed -> good  overview of why the paper is important -->
- Abstract
<!-- Like the back text of textbook, tries to sell the paper, highlights what the research question is, why it is important, how they did research and summarizes the results -->
- Methodology
<!-- Important to understand the qualities of a paper -->
- Results
<!-- What did they find? -->

---

### How to read a paper?

---

#### Quality Markers: Is it easy to read?

---

#### Quality Markers: Is it Peer Review?

---

#### Quality Markers: What is the Methodology?

- Type of data
- Type of analysis
<!--
- Sample size
- Sample selection
- Sample diversity
- Sample representativity
-->

---

#### Quality Markers: H-index

- The h-index is an author-level metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar.

---

#### Proper sourcing

- [ ] Every claim is sourced
- [ ] Every referency is cited at least once

### The Persistence of Folly: A Critical Examination of Dissociative Identity Disorder. Part I. The Excesses of an Improbable Concept

August Piper, Harold Mersky, 2004
<br/>
> In the end, positing scores, hundreds, and even thousands of alters defies common sense and reminds one of Tertullian’s claim, Credo quia absurdum est (“I believe that which is impossible,” 141).

### It’s just a body: A community-based participatory exploration of the experiences and health care needs for transgender plural people

Susan C. Turell, Christopher Wolf-Gould, Sana Flynn, Silver Mckie, Matthew A. Adan, The Redwoods, 2023
<br/>
> Academics have advocated for community-based participatory research as an important innovation to research with those in the transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) community (dickey, Hendricks & Bockting, 2016)Fine and Torre (2019) concluded that critical participatory action research with LGBTQIA+  youth “unveils the hidden” (p. 443) in ways that traditional research cannot.
