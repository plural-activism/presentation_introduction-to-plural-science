This project contains all data for the Talk "*Can you prove it? - An introduction to plural science for interested systems*" presented on the [Plural Positivity World Conference 2025](https://powertotheplurals.com/ppwc). The presentation is written in [Marp](https://marp.app/).

## Talk description

Can you prove it?

Plural science is often an daunting to approach for systems. It is full of outright denial of plural existence, be it healthy or disordered. It can be easy to feel overwhelmed by the amount and ideas surrounding it. And yet, it can be full of helpful resources and studying the science corpus enables systems to engage in discussions on equal footing.

My talk is aimed towards systems who are interested into learning more about plural science, but feel intimidated by it. I will give a quick overview how to read scientific texts, what are typical quality markers in a text, how the current landscape of plural research looks like, what are important names in the field and I will show some papers as example. In the end, the audience should feel inspired and empowered to go onto their own journey learning more about the science of plurality.

This talk is specifically aimed at people who see themselfs as amateurs in science.
